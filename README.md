# bootstrap-typeahead
Bootstrap Typeahead is used for autosuggestion list based on type text in input. 

I have customized this js and added more function, so that you can easily used this for multi purpose.

1. Li color based on condition

To change color of list element based on search content. I have added colour attribute for this. 

# Example
$('#typeahead').typeahead({
            colour: "colourCondition"
});

Here coloutCondition is javascript function

function colourCondition(item, i) {
    if (item.type == 3) {
        i.addClass("color-brown");
    }
}
